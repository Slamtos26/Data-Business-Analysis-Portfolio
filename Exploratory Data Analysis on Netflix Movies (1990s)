### README - Exploratory Data Analysis on Netflix Movies (1990s)

#### **Project Overview**
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to explore movies released in the 1990s decade. The goals of the analysis are:
1. Determine the **most frequent movie duration** in the 1990s.
2. Count the number of **short action movies** (duration < 90 minutes) released during that time.

The analysis uses Python libraries **pandas** for data manipulation and **matplotlib** for data visualization.

#### **Dataset**
- File: `netflix_data.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `show_id`: Unique identifier for the show.
  - `type`: Type of content (e.g., Movie or TV Show).
  - `title`: Title of the content.
  - `director`: Director(s) of the content.
  - `cast`: Cast members.
  - `country`: Country of origin.
  - `date_added`: Date the show was added to Netflix.
  - `release_year`: Year of release.
  - `duration`: Duration of the content in minutes.
  - `description`: Description or summary of the content.
  - `genre`: Genre of the content (e.g., Action, Comedy).

#### **Steps in the Analysis**
1. Load and inspect the dataset.
2. Filter the dataset to include only movies released between **1990 and 1999**.
3. Clean and preprocess the `duration` column to make it numeric.
4. Find the **most frequent movie duration**.
5. Filter short action movies (duration < 90 minutes) and count them.
6. Visualize the distribution of movie durations in the 1990s using a histogram.

#### **Python Code**

```python
# Importing pandas and matplotlib
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Read in the Netflix CSV as a DataFrame
netflix_df = pd.read_csv("netflix_data.csv")

# Step 2: Filter movies released in the 1990s
movies_1990s = netflix_df[
    (netflix_df['type'] == 'Movie') & 
    (netflix_df['release_year'] >= 1990) & 
    (netflix_df['release_year'] <= 1999)
]

# Step 3: Clean and preprocess 'duration' column
# Drop rows where duration is missing
movies_1990s = movies_1990s.dropna(subset=['duration'])

# Convert 'duration' column to a string, clean it, and convert to integer
movies_1990s['duration'] = movies_1990s['duration'].astype(str).str.replace(' min', '')
movies_1990s['duration'] = movies_1990s['duration'].astype(int)

# Step 4: Find the most frequent movie duration
duration_counts = movies_1990s['duration'].value_counts()
most_frequent_duration = duration_counts.idxmax()
print("Most frequent movie duration in the 1990s:", most_frequent_duration)

# Save the result as 'duration'
duration = most_frequent_duration

# Step 5: Count short action movies (< 90 minutes)
short_action_movies = movies_1990s[
    (movies_1990s['duration'] < 90) & 
    (movies_1990s['genre'] == 'Action')
]
short_movie_count = short_action_movies.shape[0]

print("Number of short action movies in the 1990s:", short_movie_count)

# Step 6: Visualize the distribution of movie durations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(movies_1990s['duration'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.title("Distribution of Movie Durations in the 1990s")
plt.xlabel("Duration (minutes)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.show()
```

#### **Key Results**
1. **Most Frequent Movie Duration**: The duration (in minutes) that appears most frequently in movies released during the 1990s.
2. **Number of Short Action Movies**: Count of action movies with a duration of less than 90 minutes.

---

#### **Requirements**
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` for visualization

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

---

#### **How to Run**
1. Place the dataset file `netflix_data.csv` in the working directory.
2. Run the Python script in a Python IDE, Jupyter Notebook, or terminal.
3. View the printed results and histogram plot to understand the findings.

---

#### **Output**
- The most frequent movie duration in the 1990s (e.g., 90 minutes).
- The number of short action movies (< 90 minutes).
- A histogram showing the distribution of movie durations for 1990s movies.
